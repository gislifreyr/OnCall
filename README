OnCall - bakvaktakerfi / emergency standby system

OnCall is designed to track/plan who should be on-call for emergencies during
which time periods, in advance. In praxis we designed it to be deployed so
that a small script/daemon could run and periodically query the shifts table
to update call-forwarding and/or nagios configurations.

License version 3). For details see the included LICENSE.txt. The included
fullCalendar component is distributed along under it's own license, GPLv2,
as can be seen in js/fullcalendar/GPL-LICENSE.txt. If you do not accept
either license, then please move along. Nothing to see here.

To setup, create a new database (preferably mysql, unless you're up to
modifying the inc/db.inc.php connection statement, which unfortunately
hardcodes mysql:) named "oncall", create the tables listed in `tables.sql`
and grant all on oncall.* to oncall identified by 'usbkubbur1';

Add some users into the staff table, the password field is expected to
contain an md5 hash.

Enjoy!
